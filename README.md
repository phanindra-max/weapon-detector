# Hey, hello there! Read through the following for more understanding of the project

## Introduction

- *Name*: Danger detection with ML
- *Created by*: Team Hack O' Holics.
- *Tools used*: Python, OpenCV, SMTPLib, YOLO V3

________________________________________

## What can it do?

- As the name says, it can detetect weapons(Guns, Rifiles and also Fire).
- Currently, I am actively looking for friends/fellow developers who know ML to collaborate and continue developing project.
- If you're interested or have an idea to share please reach out me.
- How about adding capabitlity to detect cookies in your pocket? lol.

## How to install python?
- Vist official website of python [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download latest version of python.
- And thats it Python is now installed in your personal computer.

## Installation Guide
- Dowload the zip file from `Code` button above.
- Extract the zip file open `With_mail.py` in a Python IDE of your liking.
- Now install Opencv2 and SMTPLib libraries in Python by following commands
    - `pip install opencv-python`
    - `pip install secure-smtplib`
- After installing the  required libraries, you might want to restrat the IDE to prevent any errors.
- Then you also need the yolov3.weights file to run this program.
- Since, GitHub has file size restrictions, we need to download it from this [Link]()
- After downloading the file you need to place it in the same directory as *With_mail.py*.
- Now, change the `mailfrom` variable in 26th line of *With_mail.py*
- Enter your password in `gmailpass` variable in 27th line of *With_mail.py*.
- Enter the reciver's email address in `mailto` variable in 28th line of *With_mail.py*.

### Now you are ready to run the codeü§òüèªüòé and will recieve email if any danger/threat detected.
